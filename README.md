# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project predicts **employee attrition** using an **imbalanced HR dataset** (90:10 ratio) and demonstrates **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models for retention forecasting. The project also incorporates **model explainability** to provide interpretable insights into predictions.

## Project Objective

Enable HR teams and management to understand **which employees are likely to leave** and why, so they can take proactive measures to improve retention.  
Example questions the model answers:
> “Which employees are at high risk of leaving?”  
> “What factors contribute most to attrition?”

## Flow of Execution

The project follows a simple **step-by-step workflow**:

START

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understand data distribution, correlations, and imbalance.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and prepare data for modeling.  
3. **Model Training** – Train ML and DL models on the dataset and optimize hyperparameters.  
4. **Evaluation** – Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
5. **Explainability** – Apply SHAP to analyze feature importance and interpret model predictions.
